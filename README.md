# Lab 04: Bitmap Transformer (7/14/16)

## Overview
This project reads a bitmap from a file, performs a transform on that bitmap and writes a a new file with the new bitmap data.

It utilizes node buffers to handle binary data.  

## Tests
Compares the initial data against the intended transformation to confirm that the binary data has been changed correctly.
